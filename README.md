The primary objective of this project was to conduct Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) through the exploration of the following cases:

- Case 1: Implemented the CountVectorizer technique on the dataset, eliminating punctuation and stopwords. The model was constructed using the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier.
- Case 2: Utilized the TfidfVectorizer technique on the dataset without removing punctuation and stopwords. The model was built using both XGBoost and the Random Forest Classifier.
- Case 3: Applied the CountVectorizer technique on the dataset, removing punctuation and stopwords, followed by undersampling the data. The model was then developed using the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier.
- Case 4: Employed the TfidfVectorizer technique on the dataset without removing punctuation and stopwords, coupled with undersampling the data. The model was constructed using both XGBoost and the Random Forest Classifier.
